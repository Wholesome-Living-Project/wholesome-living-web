            Hey there, welcome to Wholesome! We're a bunch of buddies from the
            University of Zurich (UZH) who got together for a master's project
            that turned into something awesome. Our goal? Creating a habit
            tracking app that's not just about counting steps or bucks, but
            about nailing those life goals while having a blast.

            Picture this: five students with different skills and a shared itch
            for making a real impact. We met at UZH and clicked instantly. From
            finance geeks to tech nerds and design fanatics, we realized life is
            all about balance â€“ financially, mentally, and all that jazz. So, we
            decided to cook up an app that covers all bases.
